# Encodec

This is a file ocntaining notes about meta's Encodec model.

## Abstract

The model is capable to encode and decode in real-time (this is what are they referring to as streaming?).
The codec represents audio data in a quantized latent space, which is a compressed representation that captures the essential features of the audio signal.
The model uses single multiscale spectrogram adversary, a technique used during training to reduce artifacts and produce high-quality audio samples efficiently.
